    ModelInterface
Models are the primitives to draw and evaluate samples.
A model could be as simple as containing only one variable.

Model variables are assumed to be independent and sampled in order via `ModelVariable(rng, model, dims...)`.
Does not support hierarchical models because of the one-to-one matching of the model and the variables.

# TODO What about Gibbs â†’ Sampling conditioned subset? In my case, the proposed variables are independent, so it does not make sense to implement it  at the moment. I would probably implement a new GibbsModel to avoid rand(::KernelDistribution) having to return a Sample.
